# dog_project
Convolutional Neural Networks Image Classification (Tensorflow, Keras) 

We break the notebook into separate steps. 

- Step 0: Import Datasets
- Step 1: Detect Humans
- Step 2: Detect Dogs
- Step 3: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch)
- Step 4: Use a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)
- Step 5: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)
- Step 6: Write your Algorithm
- Step 7: Test Your Algorithm

The image files of human, dog, and models are not uploaded here due to their large file size. 

This project uses Tensorflow and keras.
